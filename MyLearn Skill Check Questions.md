## Skill Check: Design Cloud-Native, Microservices, and Serverless Architecture

### Q1
What Kubernetes object can be used to store the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure credentials needed to pull an image from a private registry in OCI?

A. Ingress
B. ConfigMap
C. Secret
D. Service

**Answer: C** (initially selected ConfigMap — incorrect; corrected to Secret before submitting)

*Secret (specifically type `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`) is what stores registry credentials, referenced via `imagePullSecrets` in a pod spec — this is a general Kubernetes concept, not OCI-specific. ConfigMap is for non-sensitive configuration only; it isn't designed for secret material. See [[12. Containers — OCI OKE, Container Instances, OCIR]]'s "Managing OCIR images and security" section for the related kubectl-created registry secret mechanism for private OCIR pulls.*

### Q2
As a DevOps Engineer working on an OKE cluster, which file provides you access details to OKE cluster?

A. Kubernetes
B. Kubectl
C. Kube-proxy
D. Kubeconfig

**Answer: D** (selected correctly)

*Matches [[12. Containers — OCI OKE, Container Instances, OCIR]]'s "Accessing a cluster with kubectl" section and the hands-on `oci ce cluster create-kubeconfig --file ~/.kube/config` command run directly against `lab-oke-stack` earlier this session — generated via `oci ce cluster create-kubeconfig`, always lands at `$HOME/.kube/config` regardless of setup path (Cloud Shell vs. local install).*

### Q3
As a Cloud Engineer, you are asked to manage the OCI Container Registry, which hosts Docker container images. You are directed to delete all the images within a tenancy region that have not been pulled for over 72 hours to avoid billing charges for the storage space they consume. Which action should you perform to handle this requirement?

A. Periodically delete old, unused images using Docker CLI.
B. Set up local image retention policies to delete images automatically based on selection criteria.
C. Set up a global image retention policy to delete images automatically based on selection criteria.
D. For each old, unused image, select Delete Image from the Actions menu and confirm that you want to delete the image.

**Answer: C** (initially selected B — incorrect; corrected to C before submitting)

*The scenario's "within a tenancy region" scope is the tell — a global image retention policy applies to all repositories in a region by default. Verified against Oracle's docs directly (docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Tasks/registrymanagingimageretention.htm): the answer choices' term "local" is not the real OCIR term — Oracle's actual second policy type is called **custom**, scoped to specific repositories explicitly added to it (one custom policy per repo at a time), not "local." See [[12. Containers — OCI OKE, Container Instances, OCIR]]'s "Lifecycle/retention policies" section for the corrected terminology.*

### Q4
You work as a DevOps engineer and are responsible for managing the container images stored in your team's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (OCIR) repository. One of your team members accidentally deletes an important container image from the repository. You need to recover the image as soon as possible. How long do you have to undelete the image from OCIR before it is permanently deleted?

A. 72 hours
B. 24 hours
C. 48 hours
D. 96 hours

**Answer: C** (initially selected B — incorrect; corrected to C before submitting)

*Verified against Oracle's docs directly (docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Tasks/undelete-image.htm): "You can undelete an image you've previously deleted, for up to 48 hours after you deleted it. After that time, the image is permanently removed from Container Registry." Restore via `oci artifacts container image restore --image-id <image-ocid>`. See [[12. Containers — OCI OKE, Container Instances, OCIR]]'s "Managing OCIR images and security" section for the corresponding delete/undelete coverage.*

---

## Result: Passed — 100% (4/4)

Two of four questions had an incorrect answer selected initially and were
corrected before submitting (Q1: ConfigMap → Secret; Q3: local → global
retention policy) — worth a review pass on OCIR retention policy
terminology (Global vs. Custom, not "Local") and Kubernetes Secret vs.
ConfigMap scope before the real exam.
